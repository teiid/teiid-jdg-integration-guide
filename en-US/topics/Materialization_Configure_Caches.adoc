= Configure JDG Caches 

==  In the JDG Server

The Teiid JDG Resource Adapter will need 3 JDG caches in order to perform a materialization.

*  1 cache configured to be the alias tracking cache, which controls the cache name aliasing across all materializations.   1 cache can be used for all the materializations that are using the same JDG instance.
*  2 caches per materialized view in Teiid
** 1 will be configured as the primary cache in the property cacheTypeMap
** 1 will be configured as the staging cache in the property StagingCacheName

These cache names will be used when *Configuring JDG Resource Adapter*
